# front end portfolio project (Famish)

## Ron John

I will create an application using the GIPHY API for data.

### User Stories

-- I want my user to be able to find a recipe for a specific meal they would like to have. But noches some thing they would like to have but some thing that they would like to make and accommodate for a group of people. Whether it be the users friends family, or colleagues this app will Randomly suggest a food based on everyone's needs. I will provide an about link to let the user know about who I am and how I came about making this application --

**\*\*if you cannot write user stories, write a paragraph stating what api you will use and each functionality your application will have.**

<!-- ?apiKey=76adec42384e4af4a3a56a2375fc3631 -->
<!--
- As a user, when I visit the website I see a links to multiple pages so that I can navigate from one page to the other
 - As a user I can click on an About link so that it will navigate to a new page where I see information about the developer
- As a user, information about users is retrieved from an API so that I can see a list of photos to click on
- As a user, I can type in an input box and search for a photo based on the input, (e.g. cats) so that a new stream of photos will appear based on that theme.
- As a user, if I try to submit with no entry in the input box, I see a message on the screen telling me to enter a value to search so that I cannot submit without entering a value
- As a user, I can click on a photo so that I can view a single photo with information about that photo -->
