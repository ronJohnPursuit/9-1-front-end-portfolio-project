## Famish: beer brewery searcher

### about this application

I wanted to make an application so that the average Joe that likes to travel, and is also a beer enthusiast, would find a way to contact and travel to any Brewery across The United States or other parts of the world. They can take what they learned and also leave reviews for other brewery seekers that are traveling.

### Features of this Application

There is a drop down created from the JS file that showcases all the states that holds breweries in them. You can select the drop-down to feature which state's breweries you would want to see. An error message does pop up when no state has been selected(üçª).

### About me

I left in about me with in the navigation tab list to show information about myself as well as information about beer, beer ingredients, and beer lifestyle.

### work in proggress : Reviews

I would like to not only showcase reviews for different breweries, I will also like it to be a jumping off platform to add within forums for having users to be connected with other users. Users Can then populate the API to create more listings of breweries and even find ways to connect with each other.
