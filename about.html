          <h3>Why I Wanted This Application??</h3>
          <p>
            I wanted to create a front end webpage that would help showcase
            different breweries across the country and around the world. I
            wanted to make a Search tool to help find different breweries and be
            able to help people by finding where they were located and reviewing
            them.

          <h3>History of Hops</h3>
          <p>
            Hops are the flowers (also called seed cones or strobiles) of the
            hop plant Humulus lupulus,[1] a member of the Cannabaceae family of
            flowering plants.[2] They are used primarily as a bittering,
            flavouring, and stability agent in beer, to which, in addition to
            bitterness, they impart floral, fruity, or citrus flavours and
            aromas.[3] Hops are also used for various purposes in other
            beverages and herbal medicine. The hops plants have separate female
            and male plants, and only female plants are used for commercial
            production...

          <h3>Appreciation of Ale</h3>
          <p>
            HERE, With my beer I sit, While golden moments flit: <br />
            Alas! They pass Unheeded by: And, as they fly, I, Being dry, Sit,
            idly sipping here My beer. <br />
            O, finer far Than fame, or riches, are The graceful smoke-wreathes
            of this cigar! Why Should I Weep, wail, or sigh? What if luck has
            passed me by? What if my hopes are dead,— My pleasures fled? Have I
            not still My fill Of right good cheer,— Cigars and beer
            <br />
            Go, whining youth, Forsooth! Go, weep and wail, Sigh and grow pale,
            Weave melancholy rhymes On the old times, Whose joys like shadowy
            ghosts appear, But leave me to my beer! Gold is dross,— Love is
            loss,— So, if I gulp my sorrows down, Or see them drown In foamy
            draughts of old nut-brown, Then I do wear the crown, Without the
            cross!<br />-George Arnold
